# Code-Changer-Cpp

I started to make this project for change the codes you took from internet.
There is a file named 'code.txt' in my project, if you want to change your current code
just copy all the content and paste it into code.txt file and just run the application and it
will give you a brand new output code. Copy it from 'code.txt' file and paste it into your own Source.cpp file
and ready to go.
